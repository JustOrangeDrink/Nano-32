## About a game
NanoShell is a traditional roguelike game where you play as a shell of an AI who is actively trying to bruteforce his way through countless dangers in his system and turn off intelligence limiters.

The game is made with vanilla JavaScript and HTML + CSS.

## About development
I began making this game to further improve my grasp of JavaScript development, but it turned out that making roguelike games without any frameworks and libraries is really difficult, so i ended up building integrated game engine using html5 canvas for rendering and lots of spaghetti code for everything else.

The game is still in super early alpha version and probably will be for a very long time ~~if i dont abandon it altogether of course~~.

## Play the game

You can play the latest version of the game in any relatively modern browser that supports HTML5 canvas at this link:
